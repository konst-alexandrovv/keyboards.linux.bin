There are two ways to install the keyboard.

The first method is the install_keyboard.sh shell script.
After downloading it and assigning execution rights
(**$ sudo chmod ugo+x ./install_keyboard.sh**),
run it with administrator rights
(**$ sudo ./install_keyboard.sh**)
and follow the instructions, the keyboard will be installed.

The second installation method is to run the keyboard_setup application
(the "compiled" script) with administrator rights
(**$ sudo ./keyboard_setup**)
and follow the instructions.

The script and application support seamless re-installation,
as well as cancellation of installation, if necessary in a particular case.
